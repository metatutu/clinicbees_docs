_“I have invested the great practice management software (such as Cliniko), it is with all the functionalities to manage the clinic from different perspectives.  However, it’s not providing insights of individuals or teams for regular performance management.”_

_“As clinic owner, I have to spend a lot of time to manage my people while I still need to meet with patients and offer the services.  To hire dedicate people managers doesn’t make sense by considering my business size and cost.”_

>[!WARNING|style:flat|label:|icon:fa-regular fa-face-frown]
_“It’s always a difficult job for me to have performance communication with individuals.  Frequency, feedback and fairness are always tricky in real practice to make sure message will be accurately delivered.”_
