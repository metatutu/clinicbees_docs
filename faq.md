**Q: What will I get from Clinic Bees?**

A: After you agreed to our [agreement](/terms.md) and paid the setup fee and first month's service fee,
we will configure a system specifically working on your Slack workspace and connect to
your practice management software.  (eg. Cliniko).  
After Clinic Bees system is setup, your users will be able to access the functionality 
of Clinic Bees via Slack.

You may learn how to use Clinic Bees from the [knowledge base](/), or you may contact us to
get the customer support.

Upon the agreement with us, you may also add our customer support to your Slack workspace
to get online support service.  But you need to cover all extra cost on Slack.

**Q: Can I cancel the service?**

A: Yes, during your subscription of the Clinic Bees service, you may cancel it at any time.
We will refund the month service fee on a pro-rated basis.  
For the purchased credit points, we will refund the remaining ones after deducting a 20%
handling fee.  The credit points from monthly subscription or rewarding programs are not
refundable.

**Q: How could I get started?**

A: Please [contact us](https://www.clinicbees.com/#start) and let us know better about your status and needs, so that
we could offer the most suitable solution for you.
An then it will typically take below steps before your Clinic Bees working:
1. You select the plan, sign agreement, pay the initial setup fee and first month's service fee.
2. You do some Slack setup with the instructions we will provide you.  (about 15 minutes)
3. We setup your private cloud and your Clinic Bees system on it. (1 business day)
4. You simply connect to your Cliniko with a single command and your own Cliniko API key.  (< 1 minute)
It will take 2-8 hours to get all your historical data on Cliniko after this step.
Once it's done, system is ready for all users.

During the waiting period for initial loading historical data, you may do practitioner
mapping if practitioner names on Slack and Cliniko are not identical.
