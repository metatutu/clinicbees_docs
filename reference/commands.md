# Commands <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->


You typically interacte with software installed in your clinic's system with **commands**.

The command is a message sent on Slack with tag to **@bees** at very beginning (or ending).

For example:
```
@bees list practitioners
```

>[!NOTE]
>The command is typically sent in a specific channel on Slack with specific context, so
that it's with visibility to everyone related. 

The general command syntax in a message is as:

```text
@bees <command keyword> [<parameters>]
```

The message with command will be interpreted and processed based on your needs.  And the
result will be explictly responded to the message you've sent.

>[!TIP]
>Since the name of **@bees** is customizable for each clinic, so please check the name
of bees in your clinic and tag to the right one, so that the command would be well submitted.
